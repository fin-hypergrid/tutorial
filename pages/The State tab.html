<h2>The State tab</h2>

This tab provides an editor for <em>grid state</em>.

<ul>
  <li>The state is stored as a plain object</li>
  <li>This object is used to set grid properties <em>declaratively</em></li>
  <li>Hypergrid has API calls for loading and saving state</li>
  <li>Grid properties are generally own members of the <code>grid.properties</code> object (that is, not including its prototype chain, which contains defaults, theming, <i>etc.</i>)</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
  As with the <span class="tab">Data</span> tab,
  the <span class="tab">State</span> tab too uses
  <code>eval</code> to parse their editors as straight JavaScript,
  rather than <code>JSON.parse</code> which requires strict JSON.
  This is intended to make editing easier as you do not need to concern yourself with
  strict adherence to the JSON standard (double quotes, primitive types, no comments, _etc._).
</div>

To set grid properties with the <a class="code" href="https://fin-hypergrid.github.io/core/doc/Hypergrid.html#setState">grid.setState(state)</a> method is simply a matter of adding members to the root of your <code>state</code> object:

<pre>state = {
    propName: propValue
}</pre>

<div class="sidebar">
  Click the <span class="clickable page-next" onclick="window.top.tutorial.page(window.top.tutorial.num + 1, '')"></span> button above to go to the next page
  to try editing the grid state object.
</div>
